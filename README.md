# Week1
It's my internship project week-1 about solar prediction using linear regression 
Solar Power Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project demonstrates a practical application of linear regression to predict solar power generation. By analyzing historical data and leveraging weather variables, it enables accurate forecasting to optimize energy production and management.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data analysis and visualization of solar power and related weather trends.
- Implementation of a linear regression model for solar power prediction.
- Evaluation of model performance with visual and statistical insights.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks for interactive code execution.

## Installation Steps
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-power-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd solar-power-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use
1. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook solarpowerprediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow these steps in the notebook:
   - Load and clean the provided dataset.
   - Visualize key insights using seaborn and matplotlib.
   - Train the linear regression model on the prepared data.
   - Generate predictions and evaluate accuracy with metrics.
